`tubeR` is a collection of functions and tools that I use or have used in analysis for online writing.
In particular, it will contain a lot of the code I use in election forecasting.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tubeR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SentientPotato/tubeR")
```
