`tubeR` is a collection of functions and tools that I use or have used
in analysis for online writing. In particular, it will contain a lot of
the code I use in election forecasting.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tubeR` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SentientPotato/tubeR")
```
